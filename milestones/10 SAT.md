The SAT is a standardized test that measures a student’s readiness for college and is commonly used in the college admissions process in the United States. It assesses how well students can analyze and solve problems—skills they learned in school that they will need in college. Here’s what the SAT covers:

**Reading and Writing:**

-   **Reading**: This section includes passages from literature, historical documents, social sciences, and sciences to test reading comprehension.
-   **Writing and Language**: Tests grammar, vocabulary in context, and editing skills.

**Mathematics:**

-   **Math**: Covers a range of math practices, with a focus on problem-solving, modeling, using tools strategically, and using algebraic structure.

**Optional Essay:**

-   **Essay**: Students can choose to take the SAT with Essay, where they’ll analyze a passage and explain how the author builds an argument to persuade an audience.

The SAT is structured into two sections: Reading and Writing, and Math, with each section divided into two modules. [The test provides a mix of question difficulties, and the second module adapts based on the student’s performance on the first module](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/structure)[1](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/structure). [Most questions are multiple-choice, and there’s no penalty for guessing](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/structure)[1](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/structure).

[The SAT is designed to reflect what students are learning in high school and what they need to know to succeed in college and beyond](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/structure)[2](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test)[3](https://blog.prepscholar.com/what-is-the-sat-a-complete-explanation-of-the-test)[4](https://www.bestcolleges.com/test-prep/sat/what-is-sat/).
