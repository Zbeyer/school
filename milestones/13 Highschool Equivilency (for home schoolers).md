The high school equivalency exam for homeschoolers is designed to certify that a person has achieved the knowledge and skills equivalent to those of a high school graduate. Homeschoolers, like other students who have not completed traditional high school, can take this exam to demonstrate their academic abilities. The most common high school equivalency exams are the GED (General Educational Development), HiSET (High School Equivalency Test), and TASC (Test Assessing Secondary Completion).

These exams cover a range of subjects, typically including:

**Mathematics:**

-   Basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis.

**Language Arts:**

-   Reading comprehension, writing skills, grammar, and the ability to analyze and construct arguments.

**Science:**

-   Fundamental concepts in life science, physical science, and earth and space science.

**Social Studies:**

-   Understanding of history, civics, economics, and geography.

For homeschoolers, earning a high school equivalency credential can be beneficial for college admissions, employment opportunities, and other situations where proof of educational attainment is required. [It’s important to note that many homeschoolers may not need to take these exams if they complete a homeschool high school program, as they can be awarded a homeschool diploma by their parents or guardians, which is generally recognized as valid by colleges, employers, and the military](https://hslda.org/post/homeschooled-high-schoolers-and-the-ged)[1](https://hslda.org/post/homeschooled-high-schoolers-and-the-ged)[2](https://go.essentialed.com/homeschool-ged)[3](https://www.ged.com/blog/do-homeschoolers-get-a-diploma-or-ged/).
