# Rules

Don't put anything in you wouldn't want students to repeat (naugty words, for example).

## Creative Commons

Images and sources should be CC0, i.e. public domain

## Git Repository

This repository relies on Git, anyone can be made to be a contributor and each commit is a snapshot, therefore a bad actor cannot destroy the repository. The worst someone can do is vandalize a snapshot.

## Collaborators

To be added you need to make a GitHub account and add ZBeyer as a friend. Then you can be added to the repository and use the GitHub app. I do a lot of editing in `.md` or markdown. But `.txt` works fine too.

# Optional

## [Image Optim](https://imageoptim.com/api )

I crunch images down before I put them online. You don't NEED to do this, it's just a habbit I have.
