# Rules

Don't put anything in you wouldn't want students to repeat (naugty words, for example).



## Creative Commons

Images and sources should be CC0, i.e. public domain



## Git Repository

This repository relies on Git, anyone can be made to be a contributor and each commit is a snapshot, therefore a bad actor cannot detroy the repository. The worst someone can do is vandalize a snapshot.
