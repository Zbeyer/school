**Isaac Newton’s** color theory is a fundamental concept in the field of optics and color science. In the 1660s, Newton conducted experiments that led to the understanding that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors.

-   **White Light Decomposition**: Newton used a prism to split white light into its constituent colors, forming a spectrum.

-   **ROYGBIV**: He identified the visible spectrum of colors as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, commonly remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV.

-   **Color Wheel**: Newton wrapped the spectrum into a circle to create the first color wheel, which helped to understand the relationships between colors.

-   **Primary Colors**: He discovered that by combining certain colors of light, such as red, green, and blue (the primary colors), one could recreate white light.

-   **Perception of Color**: Newton also understood that colors are not inherent properties of objects but rather the result of the perception of different wavelengths of light by the human eye


Newton’s work laid the groundwork for modern color theory, influencing both scientific and artistic perspectives on color.
