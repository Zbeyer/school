1.  [**Squash and Stretch**: This gives a sense of weight and flexibility to objects, making them feel more alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
2.  [**Anticipation**: It prepares the audience for an action, making the scene appear more realistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
3.  [**Staging**: Similar to staging in theatre, it directs the audience’s attention to the most important elements of a scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
4.  [**Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose**: These are two different approaches to drawing out scenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
5.  [**Follow Through and Overlapping Action**: They add realism to the movement of characters and objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
6.  [**Slow In and Slow Out**: This refers to the timing of the action, where movement starts slowly, speeds up, and then slows down again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
7.  [**Arcs**: Natural movement tends to follow an arched trajectory, and this principle applies that observation to animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
8.  [**Secondary Action**: These are additional actions that support the main action to add more dimension to character animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
9.  [**Timing**: It refers to the number of frames given to an action, which affects the perception of the speed and nature of the action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
10.  [**Exaggeration**: It’s used to push movements further to add more drama and impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
11.  [**Solid Drawing**: This means understanding the basics of drawing, including anatomy, proportions, weight, balance, light, and shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
12.  [**Appeal**: Characters should be pleasing to watch and clear in their design and movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).
