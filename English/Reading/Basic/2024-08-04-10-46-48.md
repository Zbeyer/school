Koine Greek has 24 letters, and the English alphabet somewhat corresponds to the Biblical Greek Alphabet¹. The pronunciation of some letters may vary, and there are also diphthongs which are combinations of two vowels that make one syllable¹.

If you're interested in learning how to pronounce these letters or want to practice writing them, there are resources available that provide pronunciation guides and practice sheets¹. Enjoy exploring the Koine Greek alphabet! 😊
