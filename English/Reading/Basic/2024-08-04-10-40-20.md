# Hebrew Alphabet

Absolutely, here's a list of all the Hebrew alphabetical characters along with their numerical values:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Aleph (א)} & : 1 \\
\text{Bet (ב)} & : 2 \\
\text{Gimel (ג)} & : 3 \\
\text{Dalet (ד)} & : 4 \\
\text{He (ה)} & : 5 \\
\text{Vav (ו)} & : 6 \\
\text{Zayin (ז)} & : 7 \\
\text{Chet (ח)} & : 8 \\
\text{Tet (ט)} & : 9 \\
\text{Yud (י)} & : 10 \\
\text{Kaf (כ)} & : 20 \\
\text{Lamed (ל)} & : 30 \\
\text{Mem (מ)} & : 40 \\
\text{Nun (נ)} & : 50 \\
\text{Samech (ס)} & : 60 \\
\text{Ayin (ע)} & : 70 \\
\text{Pe (פ)} & : 80 \\
\text{Tzadi (צ)} & : 90 \\
\text{Kuf (ק)} & : 100 \\
\text{Resh (ר)} & : 200 \\
\text{Shin (ש)} & : 300 \\
\text{Tav (ת)} & : 400 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Please note that the numbers 15 and 16 are specially treated. Instead of being written as 10+5 or 10+6, which would spell out a name of God, they are normally written as 9+6 (ט"ו) and 9+7 (ט"ז) respectively¹. This list should provide a comprehensive overview of the Hebrew alphabet and its numerical values. If you're interested in the deeper aspects of these values, such as their use in Gematria, there are resources that explore these topics in detail¹.
