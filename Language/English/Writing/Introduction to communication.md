> Perception is the way we filter and interpret what our senses tell us create a meaningful picture of the world.

Long term memory is infinte. Each memory is a node, as long as you can connect from one node to another there is no limit what you can remember.

The theory goes digenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, attacks the nodes or connections so the memories are there but cannot be retieved.

Building long term memory therefore is about strengthening connections between memories.
