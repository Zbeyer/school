# 01:01-3 - Introduction

> Revelation 1:1-3
> 
> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.

-   The Revelation was given to John, but it is of Messiah.
-   The use of the word shortly means that when these things start to happen they will happen quickly, not a promise that the things would happen soon after hearing them.
-   There is a conditional blessing prommised to them that read, hear, and keep the things written.
