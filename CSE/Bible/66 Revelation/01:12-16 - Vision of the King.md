>  Revelation 1:12-16
> 
> And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

-   Like unto the Son of man, means we are dealing with figures, not what was litterally seen. Artists have tried to depict Messiah in this way but these are emblematic of His character, not literal aspects of His appearance.
-   Gold is sybollic of faith (1 Peter 1:7-9).
-   White hair is symbolic that He has authority to judge.
-   Eyes like fire means there is nothing hidden.
-   Feet of brass is another picture of judgement (Exodus 38:8).
-   Stars in His hand means authority over angels.
-   A two edged sword means His word can cut bolth its wielder and target (Hebrews 4:12).
