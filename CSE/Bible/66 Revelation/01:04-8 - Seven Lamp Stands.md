#  Isaia01:04-8 - Seven Lampstands

> Revelation 1:4-8
>
> John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

-   The seven churches in Asia are a picture of the completed church age.
-   God reminds us that Time means nothing to an eternal being like Him.
-   The seven spirits of His throne are likely a reference to the attributes of the Holy Spirit in Isaiah 11:2
-   Yeshuah Messiah is given titles like, "faithful witness" because we can trust His words, "first begotten of the dead," because He was the first of the resurrection, and "prince of the kings of the earth," because all authority is given from Him.
-   We are reminded that He loves us.
-   We are reminded He washed us from our sins in His own blood, 
-   We are reminded that He has made us a royal priesthood to honor God the Father.
