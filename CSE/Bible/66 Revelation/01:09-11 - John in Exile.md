# 01:09-11 - John in Exile

> Revelation 1:9-11
>
> I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

-   John exercizes great humility saying he is just our brother and companion.
-   John was likely exiled and not put to death because he was an influential leader. 
-   Patmos is where emperors like Domitian exiled persons like John.
-   John says he was in the spirt on the Lord's day, this is likely not a specific day of the week (like Sunday) but rather an attitude of worship.
-   John is told to write to seven churches, Colossi is not mentioned so it is assumed that he was asseked to write for the whole of the church, not to specific churches.
