# Rapture?

> The word, "rapture," is not in the Bible

That is correct, the word, "rapture," is latin and the New Testament was written in greek. 

The word you are looking for is ἁρπάζω - harpazó.

There are many opinions on the timing, but so long as we are in agreement that there will be an event where the faithful are snatched away there shouldn't be any heated disagreements IMO.
