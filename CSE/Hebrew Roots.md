# Hebrew Roots

Christianity started as a Jewish sect.



## From [A Tale of Two Rabbis](https://www.moriel.org/links/27-news/79-teaching/84-sermons-in-english/699-jesus-in-the-talmud.html?highlight=WyJ0YWxlIiwidGFsZXMiLCJvZiIsIidvZiciLCInb2YiLCJvZiciLCJ0d28iLCJyYWJiaXMiLCJyYWJiaSIsInJhYmJpJ3MiXQ==)

The Jewish religion split.  **Rabbi Hillel** started the School of Hillel. One of the graduates was Rabbi Gemaliel. Hillel was the grandfather of his successor, **Rabbi Gemaliel**. 

Acts 5, Gemaliel said that 

> if Jesus was not the Messiah, Christianity would disappear; and if it did not disappear, the Jews who opposed it would be working against God.

When the Temple was destroyed, Daniel's prediction that the Messiah would come and die beforehand was fulfilled. **Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai** — a student of Gemaliel said 

> (in paraphrase), "We have a big problem: we cannot practice the Jewish faith that Moses gave anymore." To this day, on every Orthodox Jewish synagogue you will find the term *Ichabod*—'the glory has departed, the Shekinah has gone”

Rabbi Shaul of Tarsus, better known to some as St. Paul the Apostle, was his classmate.

By the time the Temple was destroyed, Jews had one of two choices: either they accepted Jesus as Messiah, or practice a Judaism that was not scriptural, but based in tradition. All Jews today will follow one of these two classmates. Either they believe St. Paul and the law is completed in Messiah and His blood atones for sin or they follow the Tulmud and belive in a Judaism not based in scripture but in good works.

> At the end of his life, the Talmud tells us, Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai was weeping. His disciples came to him and said, "O Mighty Hammer, why are you weeping? Why is your soul in distress?" And Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai said, "I am about to meet Ha Shem – God – blessed be His name, and before me are two roads: one leading to Paradise (Heaven) and the other leading to Gehenna (Hell); and I do not know to which road He will sentence me." The founder of Rabbinic Judaism admitted that he had absolutely no assurance of salvation. 

> Rabbi Shaul of Tarsus, said at the end of his life, "Trouble me no further, for on my body I bear the marks of Christ, and I know there is laid up for me a crown of glory and of righteousness." (2 Ti. 4:7-8) He had the assurance of his salvation, and so does every Jew who follows him.
