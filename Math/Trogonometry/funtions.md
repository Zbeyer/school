## The Pathagorean Theorem

$$A^2+B^2=C^2$$



## What is Pi - $$\pi$$

pi is a constant that is used in circle math`3.141592653589793...`

For most people `3.14` is all they need

## Radius ($$ r $$)

in several functions we see raidius or `r`

This means `1/2`of the circle's diameter

## Area of a Circle

$$\pi*r^2$$

## Diameter of a Cicle

$$2*\pi*r$$
