\section{Basic Definitions}
Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects. Here are some basic definitions in set theory:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{set} is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.
  \item \textbf{Elements} of a set are the objects contained in a set.
  \item A set is said to be \textbf{empty} (or null) if it contains no elements, denoted by $\emptyset$.
  \item Two sets are \textbf{equal} if they contain exactly the same elements.
\end{itemize}

\section{Notations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The notation $a \in A$ denotes that $a$ is an element of the set $A$.
  \item The notation $A \subseteq B$ indicates that $A$ is a subset of $B$, meaning every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.
  \item The \textbf{power set} of a set $A$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.
  \item The \textbf{union} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the set of elements that are in $A$, in $B$, or in both.
  \item The \textbf{intersection} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the set of elements that are both in $A$ and in $B$.
  \item The \textbf{difference} between two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A - B$, is the set of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fundamental Operations}
\begin{align*}
  \text{Union: } & A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} \\
  \text{Intersection: } & A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} \\
  \text{Difference: } & A - B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \} \\
  \text{Complement: } & A^c = \{ x : x \notin A \}
\end{align*}

\section{Conclusion}
Set theory is a fundamental part of mathematics that has applications in various fields. Understanding the basic concepts and operations of set theory is essential for further study in mathematics.
