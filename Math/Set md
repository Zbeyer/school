\section{Introduction}
Set theory is the mathematical science of sets, which are collections of objects. In this document, we will cover some of the fundamental concepts of set theory.

\section{Basic Concepts}
\subsection{Sets and Elements}
A \textbf{set} is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects in a set are called \textbf{elements}.

\subsection{Notation}
The notation $a \in A$ denotes that $a$ is an element of the set $A$. If $a$ is not an element of $A$, we write $a \notin A$.

\section{Operations on Sets}
\subsection{Union}
The \textbf{union} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the set of all elements that are in $A$, in $B$, or in both.

\subsection{Intersection}
The \textbf{intersection} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the set of all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.

\subsection{Difference}
The \textbf{difference} between two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A - B$, is the set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.

\section{Conclusion}
This document has introduced some of the basic concepts and operations of set theory. Set theory is a foundational discipline in mathematics with wide applications in various fields.
