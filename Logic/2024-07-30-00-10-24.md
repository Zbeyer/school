# Terms

Certainly! An **axiom** is a fundamental statement or rule that is accepted as true without requiring proof. Here are a few key points about axioms:

1. **In General**:
   - An axiom is often considered self-evident or universally accepted.
   - It serves as a starting point for reasoning or as a basis for argument.
   - For example, the axiom "Nothing can both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect" is widely accepted in logic.

2. **Mathematics and Logic**:
   - In mathematics, axioms are unprovable rules or first principles.
   - They are accepted because they are either self-evident or particularly useful.
   - Axioms form the foundation of mathematical theories and systems.
   - The term is sometimes used interchangeably with "postulate."
   - Unlike theorems, axioms do not require rigorous proof.

3. **Examples**:
   - One of the key axioms in the theory of evolution is that supply equals demand.
   - The old axiom states that 90% of a tree's roots are in the top foot of soil.

Remember, axioms play a crucial role in various fields, from mathematics to philosophy. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! üòä¬π¬≤‚Å¥
