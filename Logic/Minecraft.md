## `F7` For Light

>   -   **Light Blocks**: In Bedrock Edition, light blocks can produce any light level from `0` to `15`, specified by their data value. In Java Edition, lights (not blocks) can produce similar light levels. Light blocks/emitters are invisible and cannot be mined, but can be targeted with a Light item in the main hand.
>   -   **Light Level Propagation**: In Minecraft, light travels one level for each block it passes through. This means that the light level of a block is affected by the light sources surrounding it, and can change as the light travels.



-   Every block has a light level between `0` and `15.
-   ` 0` is dark, `15` is the same as bright sunlight.
-   A torch has a brightness of `14`, the other light sources described above have a brightness of 15.
-   Each block you travel away from the light source, the light level drops by `1`.
-   Mobs can spawn when the light level is `7` or lower.





## `F9` For Chunks

A Minecraft chunk is a 16Ã—16 portion of the world, divided into 16-block tall sections. Chunks are the method used by the game to divide maps into manageable pieces. They extend from the bottom void of the world, all the way up to the top sky.
