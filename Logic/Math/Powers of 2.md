# Powers of 2
Let's explore the world of **powers of 2**. 
1. **Positive Powers of Two**:
   - These include values like $$2^1 = 2$$, $$2^2 = 4$$, $$2^3 = 8$$, and so on.
   - They play a crucial role in binary numerals, computer science, and digital systems.
2. **Negative Powers of Two**:
   - These involve fractions like $$2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}$$, $$2^{-2} = \frac{1}{4}$$, and $$2^{-3} = \frac{1}{8}$$.
   - They're essential for understanding decimal to binary conversion.
3. **Nonnegative Powers of Two**:
   - These cover both positive and zero exponents (e.g., $$2^0 = 1$$).
   - They appear in various mathematical contexts.

1. $$2^1 = 2$$
2. $$2^2 = 4$$
3. $$2^3 = 8$$
4. $$2^4 = 16$$
5. $$2^5 = 32$$
6. $$2^6 = 64$$
7. $$2^7 = 128$$
8. $$2^8 = 256$$
