# Algebra & Latex

To write inline algebraic expressions, you can use the dollar signs `$$...$$`. 

$$
x^n + y^n = z^n
$$

Here are some common algebraic operators and how to write them in LaTeX:
- Addition: `$$a + b$$` renders as 

$$a + b$$

- Multiplication (dot): `$$a \cdot b$$` renders as

$$a \cdot b$$

- Multiplication (cross): `$$a \times b$$` renders As

$$a \times b$$

Complex expressions such as fractions, square roots, and summations, LaTeX provides a additional commands:
- Fractions: `$$\\frac{a}{b}$$` renders as 

$$(\frac{a}{b}\)$$
