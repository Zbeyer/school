# Early Geometry

 As your child progresses in geometry, they'll build essential skills. Here's a summary of what they should learn:

1. **Preschoolers and Kindergartners (Ages 3â€“4 years)**:
   - Recognize shapes in the real world.
   - Sort objects by color, shape, size, or purpose.
   - Compare and contrast using height, size, or gender.
   - Count up to at least 20 and understand numerals.
   - Use spatial awareness for puzzles and cause-effect predictions.

2. **Grade-Schoolers (First and Second Graders)**:
   - Predict patterns and create their own.
   - Differentiate between 2D and 3D shapes.
   - Count to 100 by ones, twos, fives, and tens.
   - Understand basic addition and subtraction.
   - Work with bar graphs and recognize coins.

3. **Third Graders**:
   - Use paper and pencil for math problems.
   - Locate points on a grid (graphing ordered pairs).
   - Work with fractions, percentages, and proportions.
   - Understand lines, angles, and basic geometric shapes.
   - Solve problems involving area, perimeter, and volume.
