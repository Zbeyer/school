1. **Circle**:
   - **Circumference (C)**: The distance around the circle.
     - Formula: $$C = 2\pi r$$ (where $$r$$ is the radius).
   - **Area (A)**: The space enclosed by the circle.
     - Formula: $$A = \pi r^2$$.
2. **Triangle**:
   - **Perimeter (P)**: The sum of all three side lengths.
     - Formula: $$P = a + b + c$$ (where $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are the side lengths).
   - **Area (A)**: Half the base times the height.
     - Formula: $$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$ (where $$b$$ is the base and $$h$$ is the height).
3. **Square**:
   - **Perimeter (P)**: The sum of all four side lengths.
     - Formula: $$P = 4s$$ (where $$s$$ is the side length).
   - **Area (A)**: Side length squared.
     - Formula: $$A = s^2$$.
4. **Rectangle**:
   - **Perimeter (P)**: Twice the sum of length and width.
     - Formula: $$P = 2(l + w)$$ (where $$l$$ is the length and $$w$$ is the width).
   - **Area (A)**: Length times width.
     - Formula: $$A = lw$$.
5. **Parallelogram**:
   - **Perimeter (P)**: Twice the sum of adjacent sides.
     - Formula: $$P = 2(a + b)$$ (where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are adjacent side lengths).
   - **Area (A)**: Base times height.
     - Formula: $$A = bh$$ (where $$b$$ is the base and $$h$$ is the height).
6. **Trapezium** (Trapezoid):
   - **Perimeter (P)**: Sum of all four side lengths.
     - Formula: $$P = a + b + c + d$$.
   - **Area (A)**: Average of the parallel sides times the height.
     - Formula: $$A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h$$ (where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the parallel sides, and $$h$$ is the height).
