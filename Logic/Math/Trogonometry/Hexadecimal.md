# Hexadecimal
**Hexadecimal** (often abbreviated as **hex**) is a base-16 numbering system commonly used in computing and digital systems. 
1. **Base-16 System**:
   - Hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols: **0–9** for values 0 to 9 and **A–F** (or **a–f**) for values 10 to 15.
   - The order of symbols matters, just like in our familiar base-10 (decimal) system.

2. **Representation**:
   - Hexadecimal numbers are often preceded by **"0x"** (e.g., **0x1A**, **0xFF**, **0x42**).
   - Cascading Style Sheets convert RGB to a hex string, "#FFF00F" 
	   - R: 255
	   - G: 240
	   - B: 15
3. **Conversion**:
   - To convert from decimal to hexadecimal, divide by 16 and keep track of remainders.
   - For example, converting decimal 42 to hex:
     - $$42 \div 16 = 2$$ with a remainder of 10 (which is 'A' in hex).
     - So, 42 in hex is **2A**.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Hexadecimal is prevalent in:
     - **Color codes** (e.g., HTML color values like #FF00CC).
     - **Memory addresses** in programming.
     - **Binary representation** (each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary bits).
