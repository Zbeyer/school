# Algebra & Latex

To write inline algebraic expressions, you can use the dollar signs `$$...$$`. 

$$
x^n + y^n = z^n
$$

Here are some common algebraic operators and how to write them in LaTeX:
- Addition: `$$a + b$$` renders as 

$$a + b$$

- Multiplication (dot): `$$a \cdot b$$` renders as

$$a \cdot b$$

- Multiplication (cross): `$$a \times b$$` renders As

$$a \times b$$

For more complex expressions, such as fractions, square roots, and summations, LaTeX provides a variety of commands:
- Fractions: `\$\\frac{a}{b}\$` renders as \(\frac{a}{b}\)
- Square roots: `\$\\sqrt{x}\$` renders as \(\sqrt{x}\)
- Summations: `\$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2\$` renders as \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2\)

If you're looking to dive deeper into LaTeX for algebra, Overleaf has a comprehensive guide,  and there are online LaTeX equation editors that can help you visualize the output as you write.
