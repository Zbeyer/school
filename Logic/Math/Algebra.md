Algebra introduces your child to more abstract mathematical concepts. 
1. **Number Facts**:
   - Understand basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Build computational skills and gain number sense.
2. **Number Sense**:
   - Develop an intuitive understanding of how numbers work.
3. **Algebraic Concepts**:
   - Begin basic algebra with one unknown number (e.g., solving equations like $$2 + x = 10$$.
   - Use coordinates to locate points on a grid (graphing ordered pairs).
   - Work with fractions, percentages, and proportions.
   - Understand lines, angles, types of triangles, and other basic geometric shapes.
