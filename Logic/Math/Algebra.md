# Algebra

To write inline algebraic expressions, you can use the dollar signs `\$...\$`. For example, the expression \$a^2 + b^2 = c^2\$ will render as \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

For displayed equations, which are centered and on their own line, you can use the double dollar signs `$$...$$` or the `\\[...\\]` delimiters. For instance, $$x^n + y^n = z^n$$ will appear as:
$$
x^n + y^n = z^n
$$

Here are some common algebraic operators and how to write them in LaTeX:
- Addition: `\$a + b\$` renders as \(a + b\)
- Subtraction: `\$a - b\$` renders as \(a - b\)
- Multiplication (dot): `\$a \cdot b\$` renders as \(a \cdot b\)
- Multiplication (cross): `\$a \times b\$` renders as \(a \times b\)
- Division (fraction): `\$\\frac{a}{b}\$` renders as \(\frac{a}{b}\)

For more complex expressions, such as fractions, square roots, and summations, LaTeX provides a variety of commands:
- Fractions: `\$\\frac{a}{b}\$` renders as \(\frac{a}{b}\)
- Square roots: `\$\\sqrt{x}\$` renders as \(\sqrt{x}\)
- Summations: `\$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2\$` renders as \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2\)

If you're looking to dive deeper into LaTeX for algebra, Overleaf has a comprehensive guide¹, and there are online LaTeX equation editors² that can help you visualize the output as you write. Additionally, you can find a list of common algebraic operators³ and a tutorial on math and equations⁴ to expand your LaTeX skills.
