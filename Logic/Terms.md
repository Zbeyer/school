# Terms

## Axioms
> That which one assumes to be true.

   - An axiom is often considered self-evident or universally accepted.
   - It serves as a starting point for reasoning or as a basis for argument.
  
### Mathematics & Logic:
   - In mathematics, axioms are unprovable rules or first principles.
   - The term is sometimes used interchangeably with "postulate."
   - Unlike theorems, axioms do not require rigorous proof.

## Inference 
> Because x I accecpt y.

### General Definition:
   - An inference is formed by reasoning from available information.
   - It involves drawing conclusions even when direct observation is not possible.
   - For example, in science, we often rely on inference rather than unvarnished observation (just as we don't directly see electrons or black holes).

### Mathematics & Logic:
   - In logic, inference refers to the process of deriving logical consequences from assumed premises.
   - It's the act of passing from one true proposition or judgment to another believed to follow logically.
   - In statistics, inference involves generalizing from sample data to population parameters with calculated certainty.
