## Tips and Tricks

-   Immediately ask a question
-   Don't try to trick students - the question they are asked should be the same question on a quiz or test
-   Say a thing, then say it again adding details
    -   The goal is to let the student know the overview of information well and only go into details as necessary

> Always look for more ways to engage.

## Learning Theory

Education theory suggests that different people absorb information in different ways. 

>   visual | kinaesthetic | aural | verbal | logical

### Visually

Use images to illustrate information.

### Kinaesthetic

Use games and physical activities to express information.

### Aural

Use music and song to drive information home.

### Verbal

Use speech to communicate information.

### Logical

Information should be logically deduduced

-   Is it coherent: does it make sense
-   Is it cogent: does it match my observed reality?
-   Is it relevant: can I experience it?

## social vs solitary

### Social

When the student engages with others, can they share the information?

### Solitary

When the student is isolated, do they understand?

## Opinions
All complex systems are built on a web of simple rules.

Write as though you were adressing a version of yourself with significantly redused mental fortitude i.e. can a third grader understand?

> If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.
